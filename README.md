# Image Dataset of face images for compuer vision tasks
Dataset comprises **500,600+** images of individuals representing various races, genders, and ages, with each person having a single face image. It is designed for **facial recognition** and **face detection** research, supporting the development of advanced recognition systems.

By leveraging this dataset, researchers and developers can enhance **deep learning** models, improve **face verification** and **face identification** techniques, and refine detection algorithms for more accurate recognizing faces in real-world scenarios. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/face-recognition-image-dataset/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=face-recognition-image-dataset)**
